# Quick Start Guide for Enhanced Features

## üöÄ New Commands Overview

### Smart Model Selection
```
/smart_model task: "Help me debug this Python code"
# Output: Suggests openai/gpt-4o for coding tasks with explanation
```

### User Preferences
```
/preferences view
# Shows all your current settings

/preferences set preferred_model openai/gpt-4o
# Sets your default model

/preferences set response_style detailed
# Makes responses more comprehensive

/preferences set auto_model_selection true
# Enables automatic model switching based on task type
```

### Conversation Management
```
/conversation_stats
# Shows: 45 messages, 12,500 tokens, needs summarization: No
```

### Enhanced File Processing
```
# Upload any supported file and use:
/process_file
# Supports: .docx, .pptx, .json, .yaml, .py, .js, .md, .log, etc.
```

### Enhanced Help
```
/help_enhanced category: New Features
# Interactive help with categories:
# - New Features, AI Models, Preferences, File Processing, Tips & Tricks
```

## üîß Quick Setup for New Features

### For Users
1. Start using the bot normally - all existing features work as before
2. Try `/help_enhanced` to discover new capabilities
3. Use `/preferences view` to see customization options
4. Set your preferences: `/preferences set response_style detailed`
5. Upload different file types to see enhanced processing

### For Administrators
1. No additional setup required - new features are automatically available
2. New MongoDB collection `user_preferences` will be created automatically
3. All existing admin commands work unchanged
4. Monitor usage with enhanced logging

## üí° Pro Tips

### Getting the Most from Smart Model Selection
- Let the bot auto-select models by enabling: `/preferences set auto_model_selection true`
- For coding tasks, the bot will automatically use `openai/gpt-4o` or `openai/o1-preview`
- For complex reasoning, it switches to `openai/o1-preview` or `openai/o1`
- For quick questions, it uses the efficient `openai/gpt-4o-mini`

### Optimizing Your Experience
- Set response style based on your needs:
  - `balanced`: Good for most situations
  - `concise`: Quick, to-the-point responses
  - `detailed`: Comprehensive, in-depth answers
- Enable conversation summaries to maintain context in long chats
- Use `/conversation_stats` to monitor token usage and conversation health

### File Processing Power
- Upload Word documents for content analysis and summarization
- Process code files to get syntax analysis and documentation
- Analyze JSON/YAML files for structure insights
- Upload log files for error detection and analysis

## üõ† Dependencies for Optional Features

Some enhanced file processing features require additional packages:

```bash
# For Word document processing
pip install python-docx

# For PowerPoint processing  
pip install python-pptx

# For Markdown processing with enhanced features
pip install markdown beautifulsoup4

# For YAML processing
pip install pyyaml
```

These are optional - the bot works without them, but installs them for enhanced capabilities.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Smart Model Selection Isn't Working
- Check `/preferences view` to ensure `auto_model_selection` is `true`
- Make sure you're using a supported model in your preferences
- Try `/smart_model` command directly to test the feature

### If Preferences Aren't Saving
- Ensure MongoDB connection is working
- Check bot logs for database errors
- Try `/preferences reset` and set preferences again

### If File Processing Fails
- Check file size (max 10MB for `/process_file`)
- Verify file type is supported with the error message
- For PDF files, use the regular file upload (existing feature)

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### User Analytics (if opted in)
- Token usage tracking per user
- Model selection patterns
- Feature adoption metrics
- Conversation length statistics

### Admin Monitoring
- Enhanced logging for all new features
- Database performance metrics
- User preference distributions
- Error rates and handling

## üîê Privacy and Security

### What's Stored
- User preferences (customizable settings)
- Conversation summaries (when enabled)
- File processing metadata (temporary)
- Usage statistics (if opted in)

### What's Protected
- All existing blacklist/whitelist protections apply
- User preferences are private to each user
- File content is processed temporarily and not permanently stored
- Analytics can be disabled via preferences

### Data Control
- Users can reset preferences anytime: `/preferences reset`
- Conversation summaries can be disabled: `/preferences set enable_conversation_summary false`
- Analytics can be opted out: `/preferences set analytics_opt_in false`

## üöÄ What's Next
